Considerations made for application

.Net Core was used for this, I used it in an project for a bit with Angular last year and I learnt alot while attmeping the assessment but I feel I would learn alot more if I entered into an already existing project than trying to start it on my own which I would love to do to gain more experience if given the chance.
