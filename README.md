Considerations made for application

It does contain some of the data needed, however the way that data is stored is not good at all. It would be amazing to get some guidance to kick start my sleeping brain on this if given the chance.

.Net Core was used for this, I used it in an project for a bit with Angular last year and I learnt alot while attempting the assessment but I feel I would learn alot more if I entered into an already existing project than trying to start it on my own which I would love to do to gain more experience if given the chance.

(followed along with a udemy course to learn but did not fully complete it)
